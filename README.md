Some pigment / dye related files that may be useful to people playing Ark Survival Evolved
Useful in photoshop at least. Other graphic editors I do not know! Sorry. I also threw the hex codes in here in JSON in case that's helpful. I used them on DitherIt dot com. I also paid them $5 because it was helpful.
I am not great at readme files!
